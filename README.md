What is Hacktoberfest Event?

Hacktoberfest is a month long celebration of open source software. It happens every year in October. During this event everyone can support open-source by contributing changes, and then earn a limited edition swag.
It invites everyone to participate and to contribute to the Jenkins project, regardless of their background and Jenkins experience. There are many ways to contribute to Jenkins during Hacktoberfest. You can work on code or documentation, contribute to localization, create new artwork, etc. You can also share your experiences with Jenkins by creating a new blogpost. Generally, any pull requests in GitHub would qualify. See the Contribute and Participate page for more information about how to contribute.
